        Function to clean or "fill in" NaN values in incomplete data points based on
        the average value for that feature for the K-nearest neighbors in the complete data points.

        Notes: 
            (1) The first D columns are features, and the last column is the class label
            (2) There may be more than just 2 class labels in the data (e.g. labels could be 0,1,2 or 0,1,2,...,M)
            (3) There will be at most 1 missing feature value in each incomplete data point (e.g. no points will have more than one NaN value)
            (4) You want to find the k-nearest neighbors within each class separately;
            (5) There may be missing values in all of the features. It might be more convenient to address each feature at a time.
            (6) Do NOT use a for-loop over N_incomplete; you may use a for-loop over the M labels and the D features (e.g. omit one feature at a time) 
            (7) You do not need to order the rows of the return array clean_points in any specific manner
