    "<!-- No changes needed on the below section -->\n",
    "- This assignment consists of both programming and theory questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unless a theory question explicitly states that no work is required to be shown,  you must provide an explanation, justification, or calculation for your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To switch between cell for code and for markdown, see the menu -> Cell -> Cell Type\n",
    "    \n",
    "- You can directly type Latex equations into markdown cells.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- If a question requires a picture, you could use this syntax `<img src=\"\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>` to include them within your ipython notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your write up must be submitted in PDF form. You may use either Latex,  markdown, or any word processing software. <font color = 'darkred'>We will **NOT** accept handwritten work. </font> Make sure that your work is formatted correctly, for example submit $\\sum_{i=0} x_i$ instead of \\text{sum\\_\\{i=0\\} x\\_i}\n",
    "- When submitting the non-programming part of your assignment, you must correctly map pages of your PDF to each question/subquestion to reflect where they appear. <font color='darkred'>**Improperly mapped questions may not be graded correctly and/or will result in point deductions for the error.**</font>\n",
    "- All assignments should be done individually, and each student must write up and submit their own answers.\n",

    "\n",
    "<!-- No changes needed on the below section -->\n",

To download the notebook as html, click on \"File\" on the top left corner of this page and select \"Download as > html\". Then, open the html file and print to PDF.**  Please refer to the Deliverables and Point Distribution section for an outline of the non-programming questions.\n",
    "- **When submitting to Gradescope, please make sure to mark the page(s) corresponding to each problem/sub-problem. The pages in the PDF should be of size 8.5\" x 11\", otherwise there may be a deduction in points for extra long sheets.**"

    "#### Initialization: [5pts: 2pts + 3pts Bonus for Undergrad]\n",
    "The Kmeans algorithm is sensitive to how the centers are initialized. The naive approach is to randomly initialize the centers. However, a bad initialization can increase the time required for convergence or may even converge to a non-optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\_init_centers** [2pts]: Here you will initialize the centers randomly **(Required for all)**\n",
    "- **\\_kmpp_init** [3pts Bonus for Undergrad]: Here you will use the intuition that points further away from each other will probably be better initial centers by implementing a version of KMeans++ **(Bonus for Undergrad, required for Grads)**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### KMeans++\n",
    "The algorithm for KMPP that you will implement can be described as follows:\n",
    "1. Sample 1% of the points from the dataset, uniformly at random (UAR) and without replacement. This sample will be the dataset the remainder of the algorithm uses to minimize initialization overhead.\n",
    "2. From the above sample, select a random point to be the first cluster center.\n",
    "3. For each point in the sampled dataset, find the nearest cluster center and record the squared distance to get there.\n",
    "4. Examine all the squared distances and take the point with the maximum sq. distance as a new cluster center. You may break ties arbitrarily.\n",
    "5. Repeat 3-4 until all k-centers have been assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updating Cluster Assignments: [10pts]\n",
    "After you've chosen your centers, you will need to update the membership of each point based on the closest center.\n",

    "  1. Set the prior probability $\\pi$ the same for each class.\n",
    "  2. Initialize $\\mu$ by randomly selecting K numbers of observations as the initial mean vectors. You can use [int(np.random.uniform())](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.uniform.html) to get the row index number of the datapoints randomly. \n",
    "  3. Initialize the covariance matrix with [np.eye()](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.eye.html) for each k. For grads, you can also initialize the $\\Sigma$ by K diagonal matrices. It will become a full matrix after one iteration, as long as you adopt the correct computation.\n",
    "  4. Other ways of initialization are acceptable and welcome. The autograder will only test the shape of your $\\pi$,$\\mu$, $\\sigma$. Make sure you pass other evaluations in the autograder.\n",

If you pass the local test cases but fail the autograder, make sure you sum a small value like the example we given.  \n",

Of course NASA won't be sending rocket after rocket to stress test your fellow employees' engineering (they also graduated from Tech, so you have full confidence in them), so instead, NASA has decided to run numerous simulations on the current engineering design of the Mars rocket. The simulation collects shuttle data from its sensors, resulting in 8 features which include bypass, rad flow, etc. These features are contained within the first through eighth columns. The ninth column shows the label with 1 being a successful simulation and 0 being an unsuccessful simulation. \n",
